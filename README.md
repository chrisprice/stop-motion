# stop-motion

A simple app for creating stop motion gifs from a webcam, making use of WebRTC getUserMedia and the excellent [omggif](https://github.com/deanm/omggif) library. All created as an excuse for me to try out Yeoman.

## Build Instructions

Install Yeoman -

```
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower 
```

To build the app -

```
grunt
```

To hack on the app -

```
grunt server
```

(Or so I'm led to believe...)
